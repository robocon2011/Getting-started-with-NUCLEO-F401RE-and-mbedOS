# Getting-started-with-NUCLEO-F401RE-and-mbedOS
Getting started step by step with NucleoF401RE and mbed-os through an offline toolchain in Eclipse IDE 

The repository is a collection of [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) projects  .
Each project is an example on how to build a system based on NucleoF401RE, interfacing the main board with most varied sensors and actuators.

A reference toolchain will be provided together with a step by step user guide.
